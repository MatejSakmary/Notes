Tile Palette is a class in [[Unity]]
Stores all objects that can be placed into [[Isometric Tilemap]]. 
Tile Palette is created by Window -> 2D -> Tile Palette

It is possible to insert tiles, that have been rendered in different than the standard isometric angle, by changing the Y coordinate when creating a new Palette. The Y coordinate is set to the ratio of tiles' top face height/width

Some examples of how to calculate Y coordinate: ![here](https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image18-2.png)
